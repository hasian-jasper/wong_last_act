<h1>Crispy Tofu Sisig</h1>
<img src="crispy tofu sisig.jpg" align="right"><p>A Filipino Crispy Tofu Sisig cooked with an aromatic blend of onions, garlic, peppers, and chiles. Crispy tofu is used in place of meat but don’t let that fool you; it’s crispy, delicious, and easy to prepare.  This is a hearty vegan take on the Filipino Kapampangan classic!</p>

       <li>1/2 teaspoon Onion powder</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon Soy sauce</li>
       <li>Salt and ground Black pepper to taste</li>

<p>Instructions</p>
<ol>
        <li>In a large pan over medium heat, heat oil to a depth of about 2 inches until it is hot but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Tofu should be added in batches and cooked until golden and crisp, turning as necessary. Remove from pan with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix cornstarch, soy sauce, onion powder, and vegetable broth. Stir all the ingredients together thoroughly. Place aside.</li>
        <li>Melt about 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the onions and garlic with the addition until just softened.</li>
        <li>Take 3 tablespoons of the oil that was used to fry the tofu. In a clean pan, pour it. On a stovetop, heat the pan, add the onion, long green peppers, and chili, and cook until crisp-tender.</li>
        <li>Add the crispy fried tofu. Stir-fry for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>In the pan, pour the bowl containing the broth mixture. Mixture-coated ingredients are ready after being tossed. Add the mayonnaise, salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve with a dipping sauce composed of soy sauce, calamansi, and crushed chili peppers.</li>
