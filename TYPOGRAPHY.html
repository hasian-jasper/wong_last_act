<b>New York (CNN Business) &mdash;</b> Elon Musk on Monday claimed that Apple has “threatened” to pull Twitter from its iOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquired for $44 billion.

<i>“Apple (<u>AAPL)</u> has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its App Store, but won’t tell us why,”</i> Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple (<u>AAPL)</u> and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter’s business.
 </font>

In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on Twitter. <i>“Do they hate free speech in America,”</i> he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea of free speech on the platform. <i>“What’s going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?”</i> Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple’s size, <u>claimed</u> it engages in “censorship,” and <u>called</u> out the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.
 </font>
<br>

In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million followers if they know <i>“Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store?”</i> In another tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward <i>“pay 30%,”</i> the other pointed toward “go to war.” An old car labeled “Elon” skidded toward the latter.
